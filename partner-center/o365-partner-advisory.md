Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) services in some countries may be subject to special tax and regulatory requirements that may affect partner order and invoicing.  In the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada, Skype for Business PSTN and Microsoft 365 Voice services are subject to special tax and regulatory requirements. In the United States and Puerto Rico, Microsoft prices PSTN services as tax-inclusive.  Unique PSTN taxes and regulations will affect Office 365 partners transacting Microsoft 365 Voice products.  Si un partenaire affiche le prix d’un service&nbsp;RTC Microsoft, il peut avoir à calculer et restituer des taxes et frais&nbsp;RTC.

Incitez votre conseiller juridique et fiscal à analyser la responsabilité de votre entreprise concernant la réglementation, les taxes, les redevances et autres obligations potentielles liées aux services&nbsp;RTC.

## <a name="invoice-presentation-and-partner-reconciliation-file"></a>Invoice Presentation and Partner Reconciliation File

CSP invoices and CSP reconciliation files in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada which include Skype for Business PSTN and Microsoft 365 Voice services will provide separate line items for the PSTN and non-PSTN components.

Additionally, CSP invoices will display the following footnote:

* The price displayed is a charge for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plan Services.  Any applicable transactional taxes are charged exclusively of the amount shown except for sales made within the United States.  In the U.S., the price displayed is tax inclusive as it includes a charge for the Calling Plan and Audio Conferencing Services and a charge for the taxes and fees we are required to charge.  Audio Conferencing and Calling Plan Services are serviced by the Microsoft Affiliate authorized to provide them.  See [Microsoft Volume Licensing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=690247) for details.

Office 365 Enterprise E5 presents on reconciliation file as two line items with identical names and identical IDs, but each line item has a unique unit price (example: $28.40 and $2.00). Cette séparation du composant Skype Entreprise Conférence&nbsp;RTC de l’offre Office&nbsp;365 vous permet d’appliquer correctement les taxes.

**Partner Reconciliation example #2**

Microsoft 365 Business Voice available in Canada has additional PSTN taxable components that are consolidated on CSP Invoice (similar to Office 365 E5, two line items are presented, one for PSTN components and the other for non-PSTN components).  The CSP Reconciliation file for Microsoft 365 Business Voice will display all PSTN taxable components individually (individual PSTN components will not be consolidated in .CSV or API tool).  The summation of order details and billed amounts for customers found in the reconciliation file will match the CSP Invoice.
